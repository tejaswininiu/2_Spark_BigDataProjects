#My love on Data Engineering.
When I was attending Big Data Analytics class, I fell in love with Manipulating Data expecially Big Data.
I took guidance and training to self learn about Big Data Technologies.
PySpark has amused with it's abilities to process big data fastly and efficiently with out need to write 1000's of lines of code which is programmer friendly.

To put my learnings into practice, I took few example usecases and started working on it to develop pyspark solutions.
This Repository holds my projects related to Big Data Technologies.
Technologies I may use here are: Python, Spark(RDD's, Dataframes,Spark SQL,Spark Structured Streaming), AWS concepts, Kafka and so on..
